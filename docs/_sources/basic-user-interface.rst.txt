Creating the Basic User Interface
#################################

In this section we will create a basic application shell, suitable for testing
the release process on all three platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux. The
application will be the smallest thing we can create that provides both a
command line interface and a |GUI| launcher for those of you who cannot let go
of your mouse!
