Building an Indoor Model
########################

We do not actually have a plan to work from yet, but pretend we do. How will you
proceed in building this model?

1. Clear off your workspace
***************************

Simple, we will set up on some flat surface we use for building.

2. Lay out your plan
********************

For now, we will imagine placing a clean white page big enough to handle the
complete airplane. We will draw two lines on this page. One runs from the nose
of the airplane to the tip of the tail. The fuselage of our airplane will be
placed on this line. We will call this the **X axis**. Perpendicular to this
line, we draw another one that runs long enough to reach from wing tip to wing
tip (with the wing flat - no dihedral. We will call this one the **Y axis**.
There will be a third axis, one we cannot draw, that runs perpendicular to both
of these two axes. We will call this one the **Z-axis**. The origin of this
*coordinate system* is at the tip of the nose where all three axes come
together. If this all sounds familiar, it is probably because you took geometry
in high school! All measurements we will need to build our model will be
defined in this system.

3. Gather your materials:
*************************

	* Balsa wood sheet stock

	* balsa wood strip stock (maybe you cut this from sheet stock)

	* Wire for the prop shaft, bearing, and rear hook

	* Tissue to build paper tubes for mounting

    * Mylar film for covering

	* Glue (We wont be gluing anything for a while)

	* Cutting and sanding gadgets

	* An accurate measuring tool - ruler, digital caliper, etc.

4. Build the Fuselage
*********************

We will start off by building the fuselage of our model. This involves a motor
stick, tail boom, and mounting posts for the flying surfaces.

4.1. Motor Stick
================

	* Cut a rectangular strip for the basic stick.

	* Trim it as needed using a knife blade

4.2. Tail Boom
========================

	* Again, cut a basic strip.

	* Trim it as needed using a knife blade

4.3. Mounting posts for the wing and stab
===============================================

	* Cut square posts with rounded tops where we will mount the flying
	  surfaces

	* Sand the top part round for the mounting tubes

4.4. Glue the wing and stab posts in place
******************************************

This involves identifying where each post will go. On my design the posts are
in front of the leading edge and behind the trailing edge of each flying
surface.

4.5. Attach front bearing and rear hook
***************************************

This will involve bending the wire parts, and attaching then to the motor stick
centered to handle the loads imposed by the rubber motor.

4.6. Attach tail boom to motor stick
====================================

Some builders use a butt joint for this, but I will use a bit of overlap and
glue the tail boom to the aft side of the motor stick.

5. Build the Wing
*****************

The wing is fairly easy, unless you really want to get into weight savings by
using double-tapered spars. For now, let's just use strip stock with constant
thickness. Our wing will have a flat rectangular center section with five ribs,
and wing tips tilted up to provide needed dihedral for stability. The wing will
be constructed flat, covered, then dihedral will be added as a final step. We
will use a simple circular arc airfoil, common in many indoor models. These may
be formed by bending strip stock, or cut from sheet stock.

5.1. Wing spars
===============

We will use a rectangular center section meaning that the leading and trailing
edges are straight in the center section.  The wing tips are going to be
rounded at the forward tips. That means we will need to bend the spars around a
template of some sort. (We will generate this template in our work with
OpenSCAD.) Some builders use a full wing template to assemble the wing

5.2. Wing Ribs
==============

The ribs are all identical circular arcs. Each rib will have a specified chord
length, and camber. It will also have a specified strip height and thickness. We
will not worry about how these ribs are formed. They could be cut from sheet
balsa, or bent around a form.
