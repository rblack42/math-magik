Model Gallery
#############

I intend to provide several model designs as part of this project. Rather than
include all of those designs in the master project repository, I decided to
keep this site focused on the Python code that supports these designs. The
purely |OSC|_ code for each design included in the project will be located in a
separate repository for each design. There will be documentation included with
each design, describing how that particular design was developed.

The available model designs will be listed here for easy access.

Math-Magik-LPP
**************

The first design presented is for a |LPP| model. This airplane must weight at
least as much as a U.S. penny and has dimensional constraints as well. The full
design documentation is now available at:

    * https://rblack42.github.io/math-magik-lpp/contents.html

The |GH| repository containing all of the design code is located at:

    * https://github.com/rblack42/math-magik-lpp

Note that there is some supporting |PY| code used in this design. That code
will become part of the |MM|  design application presented later in these notes.
